You can run the code by typing this command in terminal:

```bash
cd online_food_ordering
python manage.py runserver
```
It is better to run this Django application on port 8000. This is because APIs,which are prepared run on this port. By default, this app runs on port 8000.

Prepared APIs are available at API directory at the root directory.
